# yoursunny OpenWrt Packages

These are my OpenWrt packages.
I use them with [Onion Omega2 Pro](https://onion.io/store/omega2-pro/) device.

Categories:

* [named-data](named-data/): Named Data Networking software
* [onion](onion/): packages specifically for Onion Omega2 Pro device

## Installation

1. Install [OpenWrt build system](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem), branch `openwrt-15.05.1`. While downloading/cloning the source code, use the [openwrt-15.05.1](https://github.com/openwrt/chaos_calmer/tree/v15.05.1)

2. Create `feeds.conf` in OpenWrt directory, and paste the following:

        src-git yoursunny https://github.com/Proyash56952/openwrt-packages

   Alternatively, if this repository has been cloned locally, use something like:

        src-link yoursunny /path/to/yoursunny/OpenWrt-packages

   This enables OpenWrt build system to find my packages.

3. Update feeds and enable my packages:

        ./scripts/feeds update -a
        ./scripts/feeds install -a -p yoursunny

   If I have published or updated a package, you'll need to repeat this step to pull my changes.

4. Have a look at the README in category or package directory, which may contain additional instructions.

5. Select packages to compile:

        make menuconfig

   First choose the correct target system according to your device.
   Then, find the package you need in the menu, and press `M` key to mark `<M>` for compiling as a `.ipk` module.

6. Compile a package:

        make V=sc package/PKGNAME/compile

   Substitute `PKGNAME` with a package name in this repository.

   If successful, the result should be in `bin/packages/ARCH/yoursunny/*.ipk`.

7. Copy `.ipk` files to the device, and install them with [opkg](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/opkg).
